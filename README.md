# League Offline
League offline is a tool to vanish from your friend's friendslist. It temporarily blocks League of Legends' chat server ports to make it unable to connect to the chat server for client. Therefor, you will still be able to play the game, and invite friends *(in the lobby only)* but nobody else will know that you're currently online or even playing a game.

# Minimalism is the key
Since the goal was to keep this app as "clean" as possible, there were only 4 colors used in the development process of this app:

- `#ffffff` White // For texts
- `#e94132` Red // For "offline" mode
- `#7fc07d` Green // For "online" mode
- `#e59246` Orange // For errors

# To do
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Working GitHub link next to control buttons
- [ ] Popup message for exclamation mark icon
- [ ] Merge all stylesheets and app.js' into one big file
- [ ] Add cookies
